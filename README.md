## FAQs

### Why did I make Symbol Tracker?
> In September 2022 I started learning Web Development, and wanted to put what I had learned to the test. 
> One of the first project ideas that came to mind, was a website to guide players through unlocking the 
> secret Deepsight chest in the King's Fall raid. For a more design oriented answer see below.

### Can't I just watch a YouTube video or look at a picture to find the symbols?
> You can, but Symbol Tracker provides a much smoother user experience. Why? Let's say you're doing the King's Fall raid and want to unlock the Deepsight chest.
What usually ends up happening is, maybe you take a screenshot of the symbols you need or type numbers in chat to remember them. Now, either you know all the 
symbol locations off the top of your head, or you look at a video / picture guide. If you're using a video guide it can be frustrating to find the part of the video you need, or maybe you need to rewatch part of the video, so you try and rewind it but end up rewinding too far or too soon, which is frustrating. If you're using
a picture guide, you have to scan the picture for the symbol you need, read the description, but maybe its not detailed enough, so you end up finding a video 
guide anyway. Not to mention, if you are taking a screenshot of the symbols you need, that takes up storage on your device.
If you raid a regularly, that's a lot of bytes being eaten up. This is why I built Symbol Tracker. It provides convenience. It gives all Destiny players an incredibly easy way to unlock the secret chest.

### You said you released Symbol Tracker back in September, why did I not hear about it then?
> Great question! And yes, I did release it back in September (2022). On the initial September release, Symbol Tracker only had support for the King's Fall raid and looked
> considerably different. If you are interested in having a look here's a link: [[old] Symbol Tracker](https://astral-lab.github.io/Symbol-Tracker-V1/).
> I would also like to add I never origianlly planned for Symbol Tracker to be available to the public, as it was just meant to be a personal project to apply what I
> had learned. The turning point came a few weeks after I had finished the first iteration of Symbol Tracker, as I felt I could significantly improve the quality of 
> the site, in terms of the UI and how I structured the code. Fast forward till now, I can say I am happy with what I have been able to
> achieve in this short amount of time, and look forward to further improving the site.
